### Start the components

To run the project locally you should use Docker compose. Once installed, build and run the containers using the command:

```
docker-compose up
```

or

```
docker-compose up --build
```

if you want to rebuild the projects.

To watch the containers use the command

```
docker ps
```

### Components

#### Aggregator

This service collects the items and prices for verified markets. It should be available at `localhost:5000/products`. You can also get a specific product price using `localhost:5000/products/id`

#### Smart Contract

It will run in the local blockchain in the container called `blockchain`. It should be available at `0.0.0.0:8545` (the chain id is 31337). Check the contract address in the output of the `bootstrap` container:

`bootstrap   | Crowdfund deployed to 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512 `
